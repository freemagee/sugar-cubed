Sugar-cubed!
============

Simple tool to allow searching for a food substance and then display it's sugar
nutritional information (grams) using sugar cubes.

[Live Demo](https://freemagee.github.io/sugar-cubed/)

Why?
----

Built for personal use and to practice writing a small [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app using single file JavaScript components.
Currently styled with the CSS Framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

Improvements to come
--------------------

- If I stick with Bulma, create a custom version with only the elements I am using
- The results area is meant to be height restricted, and scroll
- Get a build system up and running for more control
- Style the sugar cube more realistically
