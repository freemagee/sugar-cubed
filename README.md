# Sugar-cubed!

Tool to allow searching for a food and then display it's sugar nutritional information (grams per 100 grams) using sugar cubes.

[Live Demo](https://freemagee.github.io/sugar-cubed/) - No longer working as of 2020

### Why?

Built for personal use and to practice writing a small [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app using single file JavaScript components. Uses [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org) to scaffold out the app and add a build process. Currently styled with the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) CSS Framework and some SCSS.

### Licensing

This project did use a free API provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. But that API has now been sunset. A new food API will eventually be found that fits the project and then integrated.
