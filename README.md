# Sugar-cubed!

Simple tool to allow searching for a food and then display it's sugar nutritional information (grams per 100 grams) using sugar cubes.

[Live Demo](https://freemagee.github.io/sugar-cubed/)

### Why?

Built for personal use and to practice writing a small [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app using single file JavaScript components. Uses [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org) to scaffold out the app and add a build process. Currently styled with the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) CSS Framework and some SCSS.

### Fair use

This project uses an API key provided by USDA. As this is a non-commercial project and is for demonstration purposes, the key is included in the compiled code. I understand why this is bad practice, but securing the key is beyond the scope of this project.
