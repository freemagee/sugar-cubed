Sugar-cubed!
============

Simple tool to allow searching for a food substance and then display it's sugar
nutritional information (grams) using sugar cubes.

Live Demo: Coming soon

Why?
----

Built for personal use and to practice writing a small [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app using single file JavaScript components.
Currently styled with the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) CSS Framework.

Improvements to come
--------------------

- Get a build system up and running for more control
- Style the sugar cube more realistically
- Add better nutrition information. There needs to be a relative value of sugar to weight. 100 grams of sugar would show a lot of sugar cubes in comparison to 1 gram of sugar. But the UI does not reveal the measure of the food being displayed.
